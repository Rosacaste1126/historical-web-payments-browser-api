  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or
service by calling a <code>navigator.payment.request()</code> method. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be provided by a JavaScript
polyfill at first, and if deployment is successful, native browser
implementations will surface to enhance usability and transaction
security.

  <h2>A Basic Purchase Flow</h2>

  <p>
The diagram below outlines a basic payment flow with no errors. The basic
flow starts out with the <a>payee</a> offering the <a>payer</a> a
payment request. The <a>payer</a>'s user agent then helps them select a
<a>payment app</a> that is compatible with one of the <a>payment method</a>s
offered in the payment request. The <a>payment app</a> is responsible for
processing the request and returning a payment acknowledgement to the user
agent. How the <a>payment app</a> processes the request is an implementation
detail; it may be done locally or the request may be sent to a 3rd party for
processing. The flow ends with the user agent returning the payment
acknowledgement the payee for processing and, if no errors occurred, the
delivery of the good or service to the payer. There may be additional steps
following the receipt of a payment acknowledgement that the payee must perform
to execute the actual payment, such as communicating with their own
<a>payment service provider</a>, but these are specific to the
<a>payment method</a> used.

  <ol class="algorithm">
    <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s web page calls <code>navigator.payment.request(req)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
The <a>payment mediator</a> scans the list of previously registered
<a>payment app</a>s and finds matches that support
<code>paymentMethod</code> in <code>acceptablePayment</code> in
<code>request</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
A <a>payment app</a> is selected by the payment mediator or the <a>payer</a>.
The process MAY consist of one or more of the following steps:
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
If there is only one payment app that matches, that is automatically set
to the <em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is a pre-existing preference set by the <a>payer</a> that narrows the
selection of the <a>payment app</a> to one match, the match is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is more than one potential match, the <a>payer</a> is asked which
app they would like to use and the selection is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there are no matches, the <a>payer</a> is notified and may be taken to an
alternate flow where a matching <a>payment app</a> is acquired.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment app</a> optionally requests the payer to select a
payment instrument.
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment app</a> does not require the use of a
3rd party <a>payment service provider</a> or <a>payment processor</a>
(e.g. cryptocurrency), then the payment is processed locally.
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment app</a> or <a>payment method</a> requires the use of a 3rd
party payer <a>payment service provider</a> or <a>payment processor</a> (e.g.
push-payment that uses a PayPal/Google Wallet-like instrument, ACH, ISO20022
style instrument):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The <a>payment app</a> forwards the <code>request</code> and
<em>selected <a>payment instrument</a></em> (if previously
selected) to the 3rd party for approval.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>payment processor</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
The <a>payment app</a> creates the payment acknowledgement, which includes any
potential errors that occurred, and passes it to the
<code>navigator.payment.acknowledge()</code> method. This
method sends the payment acknowledgement to the Web application that called
<code>navigator.payment.request()</code> by resolving the Promise returned
from that method.
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment method</a> requires the payment flow to continue to a
3rd party payee <a>payment service provider</a> or <a>payment processor</a>
(e.g. pull-payment like non-EMV magstripe credit card with embossed PAN and
CVV2, or tokenized credit card):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The payee's Web application forwards the appropriate information
(e.g. payment approval token) from the payment acknowledgement to their
<a>payment service provider</a> or <a>payment processor</a>, which executes
the payment.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
The payee delivers goods/services to the payer.
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h3>Payment App Registration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a> navigates to a <a>payment app</a> provider website
(like their bank) to sign up.</li>
      </li>
      <li>
During sign up, the <code>navigator.payment.registerApp()</code> call is made
to register a <a>payment app</a>:
      <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a payment app registration">
var app = {
  id: 'https://bank.example.com/app/',
  type: 'PaymentApp',
  name: 'ExampleBank App',
  image: 'https://bank.example.com/icons/app.png',
  url: 'https://bank.example.com/app/',
  supportedPaymentMethod: [
    'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Visa',
    'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#MasterCard'
  ]
};

// register the <a>payment app</a> - at this point, the <a>payee interface</a>
// asks the person for approval to register the new <a>payment app</a>
var registration = navigator.payment.registerApp(app);

// called when the registration completes
registration.then(function(result) {
  // app has been registered, do something
}).catch(function(err) {
  // app has not been registered, do something
});
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Request</h3>

    <p class="issue">
Additional parts of the Payment Request may be digitally signed (such as
payment method-specific data). For push-based payment methods, it is important
that the payer's payment service provider can verify that certain pieces of
information in the payment request have not been altered.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
Can we make `type` a default attribute with a value of `PaymentRequest`? If
not, we may want to exclude it here and mention it in the extension section.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a> navigates to a <a>payee</a>'s website.</li>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a> finds an item to buy and initiates the payment flow
(by clicking a button, swiping, speaking a voice command, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
The <a>payee</a> application generates a signed payment request that
contains enough information to process the payment:
      <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a payment request">
var request = {
  type: 'PaymentRequest',
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
  acceptablePayment: {
    paymentMethod: 'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Visa',
    paymentAmount: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    }
  }
};

// request payment and get a promise that will resolve to
// a payment acknowledgement
var payment = navigator.payment.request(request);

// called when the payment request has been processed
payment.then(function(acknowledgement) {
  // payment request was at least partially processed, do something with the
  // acknowledgement, such as check its approval code or forward an approval
  // token to actually execute the payment
}).catch(function(err) {
  // payment request failed
});
      </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Generating a Payment Acknowledgement</h3>

    <p class="issue">
Additional parts of the Payment Acknowledgment may be digitally signed (such as
payment method-specific data). For push-based payment methods, this is one
mechanism that a payee can use to verify that a payment was processed.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
Can we make `type` a default attribute with a value of `PaymentAcknowledgement`?
If not, we may want to exclude it here and mention it in the extension section.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s <a>payment app</a> receives a payment request (for a
Web-based payment app, this is done via
<code>navigator.payment.getPendingRequest</code>), obtains and authenticates
the payer's <a>payment instrument</a> information, and gets approval to proceed
with the payment from the <a>payer</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
Once approval has been provided by the <a>payer</a>, the payment
acknowledgement is transmitted to the <a>payee</a>'s web application.
      </li>
      <li>
The <a>payment app</a> or a <a>payment service processor</a> it works with
generates a payment acknowledgement message
that contains enough information to verify that the payment
request has completed successfully (or has failed). The <a>payment app</a>
resolves the Promise that the <a>payer</a>'s web application is waiting on
by calling <code>navigator.payment.acknowledge</code> and passing the
payment acknowledgement message.
        <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a payment acknowledgement">
// Web-based payment app gets request via `getPendingRequest`
navigator.payment.getPendingRequest().then(function(paymentRequest) {
  // process payment request ...

  // generate acknowledgement
  var acknowledgement = {
    type: 'PaymentAcknowledgement',
    description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
    payment: {
      paymentMethod: 'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Visa',
      status: 'authorized',
      approvalCode: '10025AB',
      paymentAmount: {
        amount: '4.35',
        currency: 'USD'
      }
    }
  };

  // acknowledge that the payment was processed
  navigator.payment.acknowledge(acknowledgement);
});
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p class="issue">
This browser-based API is provided for convenience purposes only. The
existence of the API is absolutely not a requirement for the basic operation
of the Web Payments protocol. No browser API is necessary in order for a
Web application to initiate payment and receive an acknowledgement of the
result of the payment.
  </p>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to
    initiate payments in a user agent.
    A conformant user agent MUST implement the entirety of the
    following API.</p>

  <h2>Extensibility</h2>

  <p>
In general, the WebIDL descriptions provided in this specification outline
the specific interfaces, properties, and values that an implementation MAY
depend on. It is expected that other properties and values will be stored in
objects that implement the various interfaces in this specification (e.g.
<a>PaymentApplication</a>, <a>PaymentRequest</a>,
<a>PaymentAcknowledgement</a>, etc.). While this specification does
not suggest a single extension mechanism, it does anticipate
extensibility. To that end,
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Implementations MUST preserve unrecognized properties and their
associated values.
    </li>
    <li>
Another specification [LINK_TBD] explains how to extend the
parameters used with this API using JSON-LD.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="issue">
The Working Group seeks feedback from the Web community on that
specification and how well it furthers interoperability needs in the
payments ecosystem. To provide feedback, see the
<a href="#h-sotd">status section</a> above.
  </p>
</section>

  <!-- section>
    <h3>Extending Messages Using JSON-LD</h3>

    <p>
The interfaces in this specification (e.g.
<a>PaymentApplication</a>, <a>PaymentRequest</a>,
<a>PaymentAcknowledgement</a>, etc.)
are designed to optionally accept JSON-LD objects. In
order to ensure a JSON-LD object can be passed to the API properly, the
following transformation MUST be applied:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
If a <code>@context</code> property does not exist, add one and assign the
value <code>"https://w3id.org/payments/v1"</code> to it. If a
<code>@context</code> does exist, ensure its value is
<code>"https://w3id.org/payments/v1"</code>. If its value does not match,
perform JSON-LD compaction on the object using that context. This MUST be done
as there is no requirement for API implementations to perform any JSON-LD
processing.
      </li>
      <li>
Pass the resulting object to the API.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
Any application receiving an interface from the API can similarly interpret
it as a JSON-LD object. In this case, the application MUST ensure that if the
<code>@context</code> property exists and that the value associated is
<code>"https://w3id.org/payments/v1"</code>. If the <code>@context</code>
does not exist, it MUST be assumed that the object has a <code>@context</code>
property with the value of <code>"https://w3id.org/payments/v1"</code>.
    </p>

  <p class="issue">
Can we simplify the above `@context` check (when receiving an interface from
the API) so it's unnecessary by adding an optional `@context` property with
a required value of "https://w3id.org/payments/v1" to the appropriate
interfaces?

  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Message Integrity</h3>
    <p class="issue">
This section has not been discussed by the WG and is kept here as
a placeholder for a larger discussion around ensuring
message integrity.
    </p>

    <p>
It is possible to sign any JSON-LD based message by using
Linked Data Signatures, like so:
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a signed payment acknowledgement">
// generate acknowledgement
var acknowledgement = {
  type: 'PaymentAcknowledgement',
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
  payment: {
    paymentMethod: 'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Visa',
    status: 'authorized',
    approvalCode: '10025AB',
    paymentAmount: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    }
  },
  signature: {
    type: 'LinkedDataSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://payment-service-provider.example.com/keys/12',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:23:15Z',
    nonce: '239807882930744352',
    signatureValue: 'm4NTIyZTOGQzNGVkMzVkZ...OWM32NjIgoYzI43Q3ODIy='
  }
};

  <h2>Messages Addendum</h2>

  <p>
Multiple types of <a>payment app</a>s, each supporting multiple types of
<a>payment method</a>s and <a>payment instrument</a>s may be supported using
this approach:
  </p>
  <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of Bitcoin App registration">
var app = {
  id: 'https://bitcoin-wallet.example.com/app/',
  type: 'PaymentApp',
  name: 'Example Bitcoin App',
  image: 'https://bitcoin-wallet.example.com/icons/app.png',
  url: 'https://bitcoin-wallet.example.com/app/',
  supportedPaymentMethod: [
    'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Bitcoin'
  ]
};

// register the <a>payment app</a> - at this point, the <a>payee interface</a>
// asks the person for approval to register the new <a>payment app</a>
var registration = navigator.payment.registerApp(app);

// called when the registration completes
registration.then(function(result) {
  // app has been registered, do something
}).catch(function(err) {
  // app has not been registered, do something
});
  </pre>

  <p>
Multiple acceptable payments may be collected into a single payment request.
  </p>

  <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of a complex payment request">
var request = {
  type: 'PaymentRequest'
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for Widget 1'
  acceptablePayment: [{
    paymentMethod: [
      'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Visa',
      'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Mastercard',
      'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Discover'
    ],
    paymentAmount: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    }
  }, {
    paymentMethod: 'https://w3id.org/payment-methods#Bitcoin',
    paymentAmount: {
      amount: '0.0177',
      currency: 'BTC'
    },
    destination: '3QJmV3qfvL9SuYo34YihAf3sRCW3qSinyC'
  }]
};

// request payment and get a promise that will resolve to
// a payment acknowledgement
var payment = navigator.payment.request(request);

// called when the payment request has been processed
payment.then(function(acknowledgement) {
  // payment request was at least partially processed, do something with the
  // acknowledgement, such as check its approval code or forward an approval
  // token to actually execute the payment
}).catch(function(err) {
  // payment request failed
});
  </pre>

  <p class="issue">
An example should be added demonstrating how merchants can recommend a URL in
an `acceptablePayment` block that the payer can use to install a Payment App
for a particular payment method, if the payer does not have an app for it and
wants to use that method.
