  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or
service by calling a <code>navigator.payment.request()</code> method. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be provided by a JavaScript
polyfill at first, and if deployment is successful, native browser
implementations will surface to enhance usability and transaction
security.

  <h2>A Basic Purchase Flow</h2>

  <p>
The diagram below outlines a basic payment flow with no errors. The basic
flow starts out with the <a>payee</a> offering the <a>payer</a> a
payment request. The payer then selects an appropriate
<a>payment instrument</a> using their user agent and either 1) processes
the payment request locally if a local application is capable of processing
the request, or 2) sends the payment request to a 3rd party for
processing. The flow ends with the payment acknowledgement being returned
to the payee for processing, and if no errors occured, the delivery of the
good or service to the payer.
  </p>

  </script>

  <ol class="algorithm">
    <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s web page calls <code>navigator.payment.request(request)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
The payment agent scans the list of previously registered <a>payment instrument</a>s
and finds matches against <code>acceptedSchemes</code> in
<code>request</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
A <a>payment instrument</a> is selected by the payment agent or the <a>payer</a>. The
process MAY consist of one or more of the following steps:
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
If there is only one instrument that matches, that is automatically set
to the <em>selected <a>payment instrument</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is a pre-existing preference set by the <a>payer</a> that narrows the
selection of the <a>payment instrument</a> to one match, the match is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment instrument</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is more than one potential match, the <a>payer</a> is asked which
instrument they would like to use and the selection is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment instrument</a></em>
        </li>
        <li>
If there are no matches, the <a>payer</a> is notified and may be taken to an
alternate flow where a matching <a>payment instrument</a> is acquired.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment instrument</a> does not require the payment flow to switch
to a 3rd party <a>payment processor</a> (e.g. cryptocurrency),
then the payment acknowledgement is generated locally and the web
application that called <code>navigator.payment.request()</code> is
sent the acknowledgement via <code>navigator.payment.acknowledge()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
If the instrument requires the payment flow to switch to a 3rd party
payer <a>payment processor</a> (e.g. push-payment like a PayPal/Google Wallet-like instrument, ACH, ISO20022 style instrument):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The payment agent forwards the <code>request</code>, and
<em>selected <a>payment instrument</a></em> via <code>postMessage</code> to the
<code>paymentRequestService</code> in the <a>payment instrument</a> for approval.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the instrument requires the payment flow to switch to a 3rd party
payee <a>payment processor</a> (e.g. pull-payment like non-EMV magstripe credit
card with embossed PAN and CVV2, or tokenized credit card):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The payment agent forwards the request on via <code>postMessage()</code>
to the <code>paymentRequestService</code> in the
<code>acceptedScheme</code> (note that the <a>payee</a>
sets this, not the <a>payment instrument</a>).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
The payment flow is then transferred to the entity that is going to
generate the <em>payment acknowledgment</em> (locally installed
payment instrument, <a>payee</a>'s <a>payment service provider</a>, or <a>payer</a>'s
payment service provider).
    </li>
    <li>
Once the entity in control of the payment flow finalizes the
<em>payment acknowledgement</em>, even if the message is to
acknowledge that the payment failed, the <em>payment acknowledgement</em>
is generated and <code>navigator.payment.acknowledge(acknowledgement)</code>
is called.
  </ol>

  <section>
    <h3>Payment Instrument Registration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a> navigates to a <a>payment service provider</a> website to sign up.</li>
      </li>
      <li>
During sign-up, the <code>navigator.payment.register()</code> call is made
to register a <a>payment instrument</a>:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a credit card registration">
var card = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentInstrument',
  scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
  label: 'ExampleBank Visa Card',
  cardNumber: '4444444444444444'
};

// register the <a>payment instrument</a> - at this point, the interface asks the
// person for approval to store the new <a>payment instrument</a>
var promise = navigator.payment.register(card);

// this happens when the registration completes with success or a failure
promise.then(function(result) {
  // card has been registered, do something
}).catch(function(err) {
  // card has not been registered, do something
});
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Request</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a> navigates to a <a>payee</a>'s website.</li>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a> finds an item to payment and initiates the payment flow
(by clicking a button, swiping, speaking a voice command, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
The <a>payee</a> application generates a signed payment request, which is a
[[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to process the
payment:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment request">
var req = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentRequest',
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
  acceptedScheme: {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
    transfer: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    paymentRequestService: 'https://merchant-psp.example.com/services/getPaymentInfo'
  },
  signature: {
    type: 'LinkedDataSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://payee.example.com/keys/23',

    signatureValue: '4NTIyOGQzNGVkMzVmZTkZ...3Q3ODgoYzI4IyOWM32NjI='
  }
};

// request payment and get a promise that is resolved on payment
var promise = navigator.payment.request(req);

// resolve the promise
promise.then(function(result) {
  // payment was processed by the payment processor
}).catch(function(err) {
  // payment failed to be processed by the payment processor
});
      </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Acknowledgement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s <a>payment service provider</a> receives a payment request, 
authenticates the payer's card information, and gets approval to proceed with 
the payment from the <a>payer</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
Once approval has been provided by the <a>payer</a>, the payment is processed.
      </li>
      <li>
The payment service processor generates a signed payment acknowledgement
message, which is a [[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to
verify that the transaction has completed successfully (or has failed):
        <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment acknowledgement">
var acknowledgement = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentAcknowledgement',
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
  selectedScheme: {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
    status: 'authorized',
    approvalCode: '10025AB',
    transfer: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    }
  },
  signature: {
    type: 'LinkedDataSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://payment-service-provider.example.com/keys/12',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:23:15Z',

    signatureValue: 'm4NTIyZTOGQzNGVkMzVkZ...OWM32NjIgoYzI43Q3ODIy='
  }
};

// acknowledge that the payment was processed
navigator.payment.acknowledge(acknowledgement);
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p class="issue">
This browser-based API is provided for convenience purposes only. The
existence of the API is absolutely not a requirement for the basic operation
of the Web Payments protocol. No browser API is necessary in order for a
Web application to initiate payment and receive an acknowledgement of the
result of the payment.
  </p>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to
    initiate payments in a User Agent.
    A conformant payment agent MUST implement the entirety of the
    following API.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>NavigatorPayment</h3>

    <p>Navigator Payment is the name of the high-level programming
      interface that Web developers use to initiate payments. If MUST be

  <h2>Messages Addendum</h2>

  <p>
Multiple types of <a>payment instrument</a>s may be supported using this approach:
  </p>
  <pre class="example" title="Example of Bitcoin registration">
var bitcoin = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',

  </pre>

  <p>
Additional information may be requested along with the payment request, like
a proof of age credential or optional shipping address, loyalty card, or
government assistance credentials.
  </p>

  <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment request with additional information">

promise.then(function(result) {
  // payment was processed by the payment processor

  // payment failed to be processed by the payment processor
});
  </pre>

  <p class="issue">
There is a strong argument to simplify this interface by ensuring that
credentials are provided in a step prior to the payment request. The downside
of this approach is that there would be two UI prompts to the customer to
1) provide the appropriate credentials, and 2) provide the appropriate
payment instrument. The upside is that keeping these things separate will
enable each to improve independently of one another.
