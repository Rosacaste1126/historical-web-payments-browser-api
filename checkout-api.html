        This specification describes a high-level electronic commerce checkout API to enable merchants (i.e. web sites selling
        physical or digital goods) to provide a simple checkout flow for their customers.
        Merchants that do not want the browser to handle the checkout flow
        may use the more low-level <a href="wicg.github.io/web-payments-browser-api/">browser payment API</a>
        to request payment. User agents (e.g. browsers) will facilitate the checkout flow between
        merchant and user.

        of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Web Payments Working Group</a> and it is
        possible that work on the API may be transferred to that group in future.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Buying things on the
        web, particularly on mobile, is a frustrating experience for users. Every web site has its own flow
        and its own validation rules, and most require users to manually type in the same set of information
        over and over again. Likewise, it is difficult and time consuming for developers to create good
        checkout flows that support various payment schemes.</p>

        <p>This specification describes a high-level API that allows <a>user agents</a> (e.g. browsers) to
        aid in the ecommerce checkout flow between the three key parties in every transaction: the merchant (e.g. an
        online web store), the buyer (e.g. the user buying from the online web store), and the
        <a>Payment Method</a> (e.g. credit card). Information necessary to process and confirm a
        transaction is passed between the <a>Payment Method</a> and the merchant via the <a>user agent</a>
        with the buyer confirming and authorizing as necessary across the
        checkout flow.</p>

        <p>In addition to better, more consistent checkout experience, this also enables web sites to take
        advantage of more secure payment schemes (e.g. tokenization and system-level authentication)
        that are not possible with standard JavaScript libraries. This has the potential to reduce
        liability for the merchant and helps protect sensitive user information.</p>

        <p>While many merchants are not interested in designing the entire checkout flow, some
        may have special requirements that this API may not support. In those cases, merchants that do not want the browser to handle the checkout flow
        may use the more low-level <a href="wicg.github.io/web-payments-browser-api/">browser payment API</a>
        to request payment.</p>

        <p>The API described in this document forms part of the Payment Request system described in
        the Payment Request Architecture [[PAYMENTARCH]] document.</p>

      <h2>The <dfn>Checkout</dfn> Interface</h2>
      <pre class="idl">
[Constructor]
interface Checkout {
  Checkout send(DOMString itemType, optional sequence &lt;CheckoutItem&gt; items);
  Checkout request(DOMString optionType, optional sequence &lt;CheckoutOption&gt; options);
  Promise&lt;CheckoutDetails&gt; start();
  Promise&lt;CheckoutDetails&gt; continue();
  Promise cancel(DOMString reason);
  Promise finish(PaymentRequest request);
};
      </pre>

      <p>
This API allows merchants to collect the information they need to create a
payment request message but keeps the users in the same seamless, in-browser
checkout process. It will let a merchant site specify a line item estimate
(if necessary) and request a number of pieces of information, such as a shipping
address, that it needs before it can prepare the payment request message. Once
the merchant site has specified the information it needs, it tells the browser
to start the checkout process and waits for a promise to resolve.
      </p>

      <p>
The browser then opens a UI to take the user through the checkout process. Once
the user has made all of their selections, the user (for example) clicks a
button to see their total. Upon clicking, the promise the merchant was waiting
on resolves with the requested information and the in-browser UI will wait for
the merchant site to call "finish" with the payment request message (which can
be generated asynchronously if desired). The merchant can also call "cancel"
instead. Sometimes the merchant may need to request information piecemeal; for
example, the merchant may need to request a shipping address before a set of
shipping options can be provided for the user to select from. In this case,
the merchant may request that the user select from a list of shipping options
and then call "continue", which will return a Promise that the merchant site
can wait for, just like when calling "start". Once a Promise resolves with
checkout details where the "finished" flag is set to true, the merchant can
generate a payment request message and pass it to "finish" to complete the
checkout process.
      </p>

      <p>
Once finish is called, it internally calls navigator.payment.request(paymentRequest)
and returns a promise, which will resolve to an error or a payment
acknowledgement. This causes the in-browser UI to show the price and payment
app selection screen, just like it would have if called independently. If the
user selects a payment app and completes their payment, the merchant site will
eceive a payment acknowledgement via the resolved promise, otherwise, it will
receive an error.
      </p>

      <p>
The checkout flow and how the API is designed around it can be summed up by
considering the merchant's thought process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What do I need from the UA to generate a payment request? Ask for it
          and wait for a response.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do I have everything I need now? If not, ask for more and wait for
          a response. If I do, generate a payment request and finish the flow.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="issue">
Note: If a "back" feature for the in-browser UI is desirable at this point,
one option is to return a promise in the error that can be waited on, again, to
resolve once the user is ready for the merchant site to generate the payment
request message based on their changes.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
This API can be used to give merchant sites a full, in-browser, checkout
experience, but builds on top of the navigator.payment.request API. It could
also be modified (internally) to build on top of other future APIs that expose
simple, low-level mechanisms for independently requesting things like shipping
address or other "identity credentials/verifiable claims" (this is aimed at
supporting The Extensible Web Manifesto approach). These APIs are not yet
exposed as low-level APIs, but this approach is an attempt to do some future
proofing should they be standardized at some point.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
This API is also designed so that the flow occurs in a straightforward,
deterministic, singular way. It intentionally avoids events and exposing state
management to the merchant site. The merchant site does not have to deal with
multiple events coming from the in-browser UI and the subsequent management of
any asynchronous work it generates. Rather, once the user has made their
selections and chosen all of the necessary information, it will be informed.
The in-browser UI will not allow further action until the merchant site
responds with a call to "continue" or a payment request message.

          The <dfn>shipping address changed algorithm</dfn> runs when the user provides a new shipping

        <ol>
          <li>Let <em>request</em> be the <a><code>Checkout</code></a> object that the user is

          <li>
            Set the <a><code>shippingAddress</code></a> attribute on <em>request</em> to the
            shipping address provided by the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the <a>Checkout updated algorithm</a> with <em>request</em> and <em>name</em>.

        <h2>User agent delegates payment request algorithm</h2>

        <p class="issue">This entire section is out of date and needs to be updated if the approach above is deemed useful by the WG.</p>

        <p>
          The <a><code>Checkout</code></a> interface allows a web page to call <code>abort</code>
          to tell the <a>user agent</a> to abort the payment request and to tear down any user interface that
          might be shown. For example, a web page may choose to do this the goods they are selling are
          only available for a limited amount of time. If the user does not accept the payment request
          within the allowed time period, then the request will be aborted.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>user agent</a> may not always be able to abort a request. For example, if the <a>user agent</a>
          has delegated responsibility for the request to another app. To support this situation,
          the <a>user agent</a> must run the <dfn>User agent delegates payment request algorithm</dfn>.
          The algorithm MUST run the following steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Let <em>request</em> be the <a><code>Checkout</code></a> object that the user is
            interacting with.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the <em>updating</em> flag on <em>request</em> is <em>true</em>, then terminate this
            algorithm and take no further action. The <a>user agent</a> user interface should ensure
            that this never occurs.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the <a><code>state</code></a> of <em>request</em> is not <code>interactive</code>,
            then terminate this algorithm and take no further action. The <a>user agent</a> user
            interface should ensure that this never occurs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the <a><code>state</code></a> of <em>request</em> to <code>delegated</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="issue" data-number="33" title="Should we support a delegated state for Checkout?">
          <p>We believe there are <a>user agent</a> configurations that can cause the UI to get into a state
          where cancellation by the web page during user interaction is difficult. Users should still
          be able to cancel the payment but script will not be able to. We need to investigate in more
          detail the consequences of this and whether it is really needed.</p>
          <p>If we specify <code>delegated</code> then it isn't necessary for all <a>user agents</a> to be
          able to move to this state but it would be necessary for all payment flows that wish to call
          <a><code>abort</code></a> to account for the situation where this may fail in the <code>delegated</code>
          state.</p>

  <h2>Extensibility</h2>

  <p>
In general, the WebIDL descriptions provided in this specification outline
the specific interfaces, properties, and values that an implementation MAY
depend on. It is expected that other properties and values will be stored in
objects that implement the various interfaces in this specification (e.g.
<a>CheckoutDetails</a>, <a>ShippingAddress</a>,
<a>CheckoutItem</a>, etc.). While this specification does not
suggest a single extension mechanism, it does assert that
extensibility MUST be possible. To that end,
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Implementations MUST preserve unrecognized properties and their
associated values.
    </li>
    <li>
Another specification [LINK_TBD] explains how to extend the
parameters used with this API using JSON-LD.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="issue">
The Working Group seeks feedback from the Web community on that
specification and how well it furthers interoperability needs in the
payments ecosystem. To provide feedback, see the
